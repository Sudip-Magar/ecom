        summ: `The first monograph on fashion designer Prabal Gurung, packed with stories, design inspiration, and never-before-seen photographs In February 2017, Prabal Gurung ended his show with a parade of feminist tees featuring phrases like "This Is What a Feminist Looks Like," "Voices for Choices," and "We Will Not Be Silenced." A year later, his collection took inspiration from two female-dominated Asian cultures. Activism is built into designer Gurung's ethos and the celebration of female empowerment serves as a constant focal point of his designs. He presents femininity with a bite, beauty with substance, and a diverse, inclusive world that is "Stronger in Color." Prabal Gurung offers a window into Gurung's design process, and it is filled with inspiration, mood boards, sketches, runway shots, and photographs of the clothing from the last 10 years. The Prabal Gurung woman is modern, intelligent, elegant, assured, and socially responsible, and this book is a celebration of people of all ages, races, shapes, sizes, sexualities, and identities.`,

        author: 'Bella Bathurst',
        summ: `An exciting new edition of Bella Bathurst's epic story of Robert Louis Stevenson's ancestors and the building of the Scottish coastal lighthouses against impossible odds. 'Whenever I smell salt water, I know that I am not far from one of the works of my ancestors,' wrote Robert Louis Stevenson in 1880. 'When the lights come out at sundown along the shores of Scotland, I am proud to think they burn more brightly for the genius of my father!' Robert Louis Stevenson was the most famous of the Stevensons, but not by any means the most productive. The Lighthouse Stevensons, all four generations of them, built every lighthouse round Scotland, were responsible for a slew of inventions in both construction and optics, and achieved feats of engineering in conditions that would be forbidding even today. The same driven energy which Robert Louis Stevenson put into writing, his ancestors put into lighting the darkness of the seas. The Lighthouse Stevensons is a story of high endeavour, beautifully told; indeed, Bella Bathurst writes like a dream and this was one of the most celebrated works of historical biography in recent memory. As a unique history that evokes the exact feel of time and place, this book is quite exceptional. 'My own interest in the Lighthouse Stevensons is threefold. Firstly, from the writings of Robert Louis Stevenson, who turned his family's trade into the raw gold of all his best fiction. Secondly, from various trips around Scotland. The country's coast is a mass of storm-beaten rocks and treacherous headlands on which even the seagulls have trouble landing. It is impossible not to speculate what combination of courage and skill built the lighthouses around such an environment. And thirdly, because somewhere in there, unrecognised and unsung, is the

The author along with his family decides to take a trip to the outlandish Iceland. It was a huge task first of all to convince his family to side-line a trip to the sandy beaches of Italy or France and linger upon the idea of a country which has active volcanoes. After a delayed nod, they set on a road trip to discover the most unusual tourist destinations in the world. So, what sets Iceland apart, the black beaches, or a crashed plane turned into a tourist spot, or the city where the population of people can be counted on your fingers? Or the non-existence of mosquitoes & McDonalds. They don't coincide but you cannot find one in Iceland. Read their journey about how the author faces his family's indolent behaviour and how he deals with it throughout the whole trip. And also, take a glimpse of a rendition of 'Gerua', Gupta family style.`,

A Tibetan inscription calls Tibet 'divine territory... a land that is a mine of wisdom'. The rich artistic heritage of Tibet reveals the depths of meditations of great Masters, translated into the majestic abundance of iconic symbols that take the form of three-dimensional images or two dimensional thankas. Tibetan Art is a comprehensive introduction to the complex iconography of thankas, providing a glimpse of the richness of this art and of the land where it flourished. It takes the reader on a journey of self-discovery: Buddhist deities do not exist outside us but represent aspects of innate human potential. With no distinct, independent existence or objective reality, these deities are but symbols of abstract qualities.

Could this mysterious discovery have something to do with the possibly extraterrestrial organism spreading throughout the Pacific? Dr. Mariella Anders is recruited by NASA to join an urgent mission to the Red Planet to find out just what the Chinese might be hiding. A brilliant and committed scientist, Mariella only wants to uncover the truth, but others have less noble motives. Corporate powers want to monopolize the genetic secrets of the slick. Radical eco terrorists strike out at those they blame for rampant genetic engineering. And a second Chinese Mars mission has its own unguessable agenda."

The Secret of Life is a powerful novel about the perilous quest for knowledge - and the high price of the truth."--BOOK JACKET.`,

Unwilling at first, India was prompted to enter the ring in the wake of the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. The contest that followed proved to be a 'second war of Independence' in the words of then foreign minister Sushma Swaraj - and a David-and-Goliath fight against the permanent members of the Security Council, who all put their might behind the UK.

        summ: `Revolution in Nepal is a comprehensive study of the People's War in Nepal that was waged by the Maoist party. The chapters are based on extensive fieldwork conducted at the grass-roots level, covering the country's rural areas from Khotang to Jumla, before, during, and after the revolutionary movement. They focus on village life and its micro history under Maoist control. The volume also examines the War's antecedents, such as the anti-Rana and anti-Panchayat movements, and the various ways in which the Maoist revolution developed in the country's rural areas. Thus, with an anthropological and historical approach, it presents an account of the impact of the People's War in the country. By doing so, it reflects the revolution brought about in the conception of Nepalese history, which is now commonly presented as a series of uprisings.`,

As the story progresses and his journey continues, Kim begins to learn more and more about what is known as the Great Game. As we follow Kim, we see him transformed from a simple vagabond into a sharpened operative in the dangerous world of politics, betrayal and death. All the excitement of Kim's adventures takes place in the backdrop of a beautiful country full of amazing sights, incredible sounds and an extremely rich culture. In what is considered by many to be Kipling's finest work, he draws on his own experiences of living in India to tell an unforgettable and action-packed story within a vivid and accurate setting.`,

In a continent on the edge of war, two witches hold its fate in their hands. Young witches Safiya and Iseult have a habit of finding trouble. After clashing with a powerful Guildmaster and his ruthless Bloodwitch bodyguard, the friends are forced to flee their home. Safi must avoid capture at all costs as she's a rare Truthwitch, able to discern truth from lies. Many would kill for her magic, so Safi must keep it hidden - lest she be used in the struggle between empires. And Iseult's true powers are hidden even from herself. In a chance encounter at Court, Safi meets Prince Merik and makes him a reluctant ally. However, his help may not slow down the Bloodwitch now hot on the girls' heels. All Safi and Iseult want is their freedom, but danger lies ahead. With war coming, treaties breaking and a magical contagion sweeping the land, the friends will have to fight emperors and mercenaries alike. For some will stop at nothing to get their hands on a Truthwitch.`,

        summ: `From fatal heatwaves and cruel droughts to devastating floods and fast-depleting water tables, climate change is the greatest disruptor of our time ‚Äì and it can no longer be ignored. For most of us the odds seem overwhelming and solutions out of reach. Yet, in this forcefully argued book, climate-change practitioner, teacher and investor Mridula Ramesh emphasizes that while the situation is grim, it is not without hope. Drawing on her extensive practical and investing experience, she explores myriad facets of this raging issue: why women are peculiarly affected by a warming climate; how climate change poses a security threat to the Indian state; why just focusing on green sources of power is an incomplete solution for India; how managing waste can create lakhs of urban jobs; and how households can cope in a ‚ÄòDay Zero‚Äô water situation. In doing so, she shows how climate warriors, from the cotton fields of Punjab and thriving eco start-ups in Bengaluru to a forest guardian in Assam and the johads of Rajasthan, have employed ingenuity and initiative to adapt to the changing conditions ‚Äì and sometimes reverse their shattering effects. Timely, urgent and thought-provoking, this book is an urgent call to action ‚Äì and an essential manifesto for every Indian citizen to follow.`,

        author: 'Vipul Negi',
        summ: `It is a book for hiking, thriving and learning in the outdoors. The book is mainly divided into four parts: Wilderness learnings, Reading Nature, Wilderness Medicine and Wilderness travel. . The first part of the book primarily talks about leadership skills, ethics and resilience. . The second part of the book, is my favourite part. I absolutely enjoyed reading it. It talks in detail about reading the signs of nature, something that all of us want to do. Predicting weather just by looking at the clouds? I'm quite good at it now. :) From finding direction of the wind, using Sun's position to calculate time to reading flora and fauna, it has covered all of them. I have started using these signs in my life as well. . Talking about Wilderness Medicine, it's mainly (but not completely) about major and minor injuries that are common in the outdoors and ways to treat them. It's quite intricate. . Wilderness Travel discusses about the essentials of traveling in the outdoors. It covers even the most basic requirements like clothing, backpacks and footwears. You would also learn to tie various types of knots and reading maps in this section. . The last part of the book is about Wilderness ethics, something that all of us need to learn. . What I liked about the book: -The author himself is a wilderness research and risk management expert. He has shared some of his experiences in the book, which makes it personal and connecting. - Even though, all the threats of traveling in the outdoors have been discussed in here, but the author still motivates people to go out and explore nature. -The book is filled with encouraging words. - The author has taken into account the common mistakes that people often commit and discussed them. - This book will definitely make you fall in love with nature and you will learn to respect it as well. . It is a great book for the people who love to venture out into the nature. However, I'm not much of a traveller, so I could not relate to all the parts of the book.`,

Nepal presents a balanced prospect of cultural and adventure tours, a rare occasion to witness nature‚Äôs incredulities all mingled with smart, warm hospitality, probably inspired by the country‚Äôs alluring mystifying presence as a tourism destination. As we move along Kathmandu‚Äôs hills, as we get away from the central city, we awake to the chorus of birds, melodies of nature‚Äôs greatest musical compositions. High above on the hills around the Kathmandu valley one can distinctly hear enchanting sounds of birds at a distance. Spanning the dense forests all around, one can feel the natural enigma of the mysterious world of birds and their songs in solitude. These forests are bursting with biology and are rich of flora and fauna happily shoehorned into a refreshingly calm green sanctuary of pristine wonder. Few places enjoy such a sterling reputation, tempting and teasing the curiosity within us to walk a few paces more and see nature‚Äôs wings, the birds of the Himalayas and their ruler, the spiny babbler itself. The Spiny Babbler (Turdoides nipalensis) is a magnificent brown bird found only in Nepal. It can be sighted around the Kathmandu valley, specifically around the Godavari and Phulchoki area close to the city of Lalitpur. The Spiny Babbler is a medium sized bird with a sharp beak and is quite shy. It rarely comes before humans but can be distinctly sighted around Phulchoki. Also known locally as the ‚ÄúKande Bhyakura‚Äù, literally translated ‚Äúthorny bird‚Äù, it features in stories, poems and folklore of Nepal. Although the spiny babbler population does not fear extinction, it must still be appreciated and protected. For over a century, this bird was considered extinct. It was only when Sidney Dillon Ripley, an American ornithologist spotted it in Nepal that the world came to know about its existence. The bird has a range restriction and its population keeps fluctuating.`,
